<p class="article-tagline sans"><span class="lead-in">Faculty-led:</span> General education — and its assessment — are overseen by the faculty senate-appointed committee for UCORE, with support from the Provost’s Office.  Beginning in Spring 2016, UCORE established a subcommittee for assessment.</p>
<p class="nrml"><strong>Assessment planning includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Collecting assessment data on student learning — using a mix of direct measures, indirect measures, and other indicators — in order to recognize strengths and recommend improvements in curriculum, pedagogy, faculty development, policies or other decisions intended to support learning in general education courses and curriculum.</li>
	<li>Supporting and improving meaningful and sustainable assessment processes for general education curriculum, courses and related support.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<p class="nrml">WSU’s general education—and its assessment—is designed to complement and integrate with curricula, courses, and instruction in the departments and academic programs. WSU’s system for meaningful and sustainable assessment in general education is designed to implement in our local context good practices identified by Dr. Barbara Walvoord and other scholars.</p>
