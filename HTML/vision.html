<p><strong>Assessment is intended to help faculty, departments, and university leadership determine to what extent undergraduates are achieving the Seven Learning Goals of the Baccalaureate, WSU’s general education program. </strong></p>
<p>Faculty participate on UCORE’s subcommittee for assessment and also contribute to assessment of UCORE-designated courses.  Assessment is a collaborative process that includes faculty, students, staff, administrators, and others.  The Office of Assessment of Teaching and Learning assists with UCORE assessment, by supporting and managing specific assessment-related initiatives, analyzing and reporting results, and maintaining assessment archives.</p>
<h4><strong>Vision for General Education</strong></h4>
<p>WSU’s general education program helps students acquire broad knowledge of the wider world that complements their specific areas of study. Through this broad exposure to multiple disciplines, students will develop intellectual and civic competencies, practical skills and the ability to apply knowledge and skills in real-world settings.  WSU graduates will be prepared to address diverse, complex issues, for the benefit of themselves, their communities, their employers, and for society at large.</p>
<h4><strong>Seven Learning Goals of the Baccalaureate</strong></h4>
<p>All bachelor's degree requirements are rooted in the Seven Learning Goals: Critical and Creatives Thinking; Quantitative Reasoning; Scientific Literacy; Information Literacy; Communication; Diversity; Depth, Breadth and Integration of Knowledge.</p>
<h4><strong>University Core Requirements (UCORE)</strong></h4>
<p>WSU’s general education program, known as University Common Requirements (UCORE), is the centerpiece of the undergraduate curriculum supporting the Seven Learning Goals of the Baccalaureate.  While the greater part of students’ courses of study is devoted to their major fields, the UCORE curriculum provides balance between the specialized focus of the major and the broader traditional objectives of higher education. UCORE offers a wide variety of elective choices and provides many individual pathways through the curriculum, including introductory, advanced, and integrative forms of learning.</p>
<p>UCORE is bookended by a required first-year course and a senior capstone experience.  Foundational courses and inquiry-based learning in the disciplines are complemented by a diversity requirement that embraces both American and global issues.  The program’s structure includes coursework in contemporary issues, social sciences, humanities, creative or professional arts, quantitative reasoning, natural sciences, and diversity, as well as communication, computation, and human relations, to support achievement of WSU’s Seven Learning Goals of the Baccalaureate. </p>
