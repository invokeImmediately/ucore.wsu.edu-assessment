NSSE results are also disaggregated for undergraduate academic degree programs, colleges, and campuses to provide information about the student perspective to help continually improve the learning experience for students. NSSE reports provide participating institutions with results that compare their students’ responses with those of students at self-selected groups of comparison institutions. Universities can use their NSSE results to identify aspects of the undergraduate experience that can be improved through changes in policy and practice. </p>

				<h3 id="degree-use">Undergraduate Program Degree Assessment Reporting</h3>
				<p>WSU-wide summaries of undergraduate degree program assessment reporting are shared with institutional leadership and contribute to regional accreditation. Summaries are also compiled for each college and campus to provide a snapshot of assessment for discussion with college or campus leadership. Additionally, as part of Undergraduate Degree Program Assessment Reporting, degree programs describe how they’ve used assessment to inform decisions. Decisions may relate to curriculum and instruction or they may be related to other aspects of the degree program, including the assessment process. Some degree program assessment is aligned with specific student learning outcomes, while other assessment relates more broadly to student experience in a degree program.</p>
				<p>Below are some examples, organized by decision and assessment type, of how WSU undergraduate degree programs used assessment to inform decisions as reported in the annual undergraduate degree program assessment reports. The examples, like the annual program reports themselves, look at key or representative activities and uses, and are not intended to be exhaustive or show all uses of assessment results by WSU programs.</p>

				<p class="nrml">While difficult to capture, some impacts also cumulate and contribute over time to promoting student learning at WSU and are not immediately visible:</p>
				<p><strong>Increasing shared faculty understanding curriculum</strong></p>
				<p>Assessment activities and discussion of results offer ways for faculty to think about student learning in the curriculum and how to support it most effectively in their own classes, increasing shared faculty understanding of the curriculum.  For example, norming on a rubric can deepen a common understanding of particular learning outcomes among faculty, and, over time, can help focus instruction and improve communication and feedback to students.</p>
				<p><strong>Sowing seeds that promote faculty learning </strong></p>
				<p>As avenues of organizational change, dialog and collaboration within the faculty collective on assessment-related activities can stimulate faculty learning and development -- which over time feeds into continual improvement of teaching and learning. Though not immediately visible, influences may include: personal transformation in thinking about a particular aspect of teaching or learning, or how learning occurs; changes to faculty motivation or attitudes; disruptions to conventional wisdom which allow faculty to re-examine an issue in the future; or building communities of practice within key courses, programs or a department.</p>
